# Lecturing Overview

This section is where you can provide information about the subjects you teach and your lecturing experience.

- To get started, edit this file (`content/lecturing/_index.md`) to give an overview of your teaching.

- For specific subjects, create individual pages like **content/lecturing/subject_name.md**.
- You can link to these subjects from this page using < relref subject_name>:

```markdown
## [Subject 1]({{< relref "subject1.md" >}})
```

## [Subject 1]({{< relref "subject1.md" >}})

## [Subject 2]({{< relref "subject2.md" >}})
