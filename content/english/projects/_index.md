# Projects

This page serves as an overview of all the projects you're involved in. You can list and describe each project briefly, with links to more detailed pages for each specific project. It acts as a directory for your research and personal work.

Example:

- [**Project 1**]({{<relref "project1.md">}}) - A machine learning project focused on optimizing algorithms for large datasets.
- [**Project 2**]({{<relref "project2.md">}})- A research project studying the application of AI in healthcare.

Each project can have its own page for more in-depth details.
