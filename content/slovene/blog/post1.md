# Exploring a New Research Idea

Recently, I started exploring a new research idea in the field of artificial intelligence. The goal is to develop a model that can better understand user intent in natural language. It’s still early, but the initial results are promising.

Some challenges include fine-tuning the model to work efficiently with smaller datasets and ensuring fairness and transparency in predictions. I’m excited to see where this research leads and will share updates as the project develops!
